Building
=========

In the base directory type make

Note:
  You need a machine with gcc and with the openmp libraries installed!


Running
========

Run the program bsort.  It takes the following parameters

./bsort array_size RAND_SEED nthreads

array_size: the size of the array to allocate and sort
RAND_SEED: is the seed used for the RNG.
nthreads: The number of threads to use in sorting

NOTE: If nthreads is 1, then the bubble_sort_serial() function will be used.  If nthreads > 1, then the bubble_sort_parallel() function will be used.
