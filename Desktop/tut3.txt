1. Yes. By this command line instruction:

cat /proc/[pid]/status | grep -i rss
this one returns the memory usage of process [pid] in RAM
cat /proc/[pid]/status | grep -i vmsize 
this one returns the virtual memory usage

And the working set size would be the virtual memory usage.
If it is about the page numbers in total it would be : vmsize/pagesize

And you can get page size through: $ getconf PAGESIZE

Also you can open the file in /proc/[pid]/statm in which the first number is exactly the virtual page number in total.

2. By the instruction "lscpu" you can get information of:

L1d cache:             32K
L1i cache:             32K
L2 cache:              256K
L3 cache:              3072K

both the level-1 cache of data and instruction;
the level-2 cache and the last level cache of 3072KB;

3. The size of the structure is 8. Although sizeof(char*)=4 and sizeof(char)=1. Since in memory there is alignment requirement, it would be like:

4 Byte
3 padding + 1 Byte
